## Introduction 
Scheduled allows you to write cron jobs right from PHP files. 
It works for CakePHP shell as well as any other valid PHP code. 
Basically it is a replacement of the conventional crontab file. 

## Why Use It
The conventional way of writing a cron job is to place an entry in the crontab file each time you 
need to schedule a job. The problem with this approach is that you have to login(SSH) to the server 
each time. 

By using Scheduled, we are able to place the cron jobs in the source control system and deploy 
them to production just like any other PHP code.  

## Installation

+ To install the Scheduled plugin, you can use composer. From your application's ROOT directory (where composer.json file is located) run the following:

    ```composer require cakephp-scheduled-plugin```


	
+ Load the plugin via the following command:

	```bin/cake plugin load Scheduled```

+ You can add the following line to your application's `src/Application.php` file:

    ```Plugin::load('Scheduled');```
    
## Starting The Scheduled

We only need to install one ordinary cron job which runs every minute.
This cron job will enable Scheduled to schedule all the subsequent jobs:

```* * * * * /path-to-project/bin/cake Scheduled run```

## Defining Schedules
A schedule is basically a PHP file prefix with **Scheduled** and ending with **Task.php**, it must return the **Scheduled** object.
All schedules should be place inside a folder called **ScheduledTasks**. This folder must reside at the root directory 
where composer.json file is located.

For example:
```php
// path-to-project/src/ScheduledTasks/ScheduledBackupTask.php

use Scheduled\Scheduled\Scheduled;
$schedule = new \Scheduled\Scheduled\Scheduled();
$scheduled
    ->run('/usr/bin/php backup.php')
    ->daily()
    ->description('Test');

// IMPORTANT: You must return the scheduled object
return $scheduled;
```

### Scheduling CakePHP Shell
To schedule a CakePHP shell, call *Scheduled::shell*:

```$scheduled->shell('MyCake awesome')```

### Scheduling Any Other Commands
To schedule any other commands, call *Scheduled::run*:

```$scheduled->run('/usr/bin/php backup.php')```

### Frequency Options

There is plenty of ways to define the frequency of the execution:


| Method        |   	Description |
|---            |       ---     |
| ->cron()        |  the classic way of defining a schedule |
| ->hourly()      |  beginning of each hour|
| ->daily()   	|  daily at midnight|
| ->weekly    	|  sunday of each week	|
| ->monthly()   	|  first day of each month	|
| ->quarterly()   |  first day of each quarter	|
| ->yearly()   	|  first day of each year	|
| ->everyFiveMinutes() |    every five minutes      |
| ->everyMinute()     |   every minute        |
| ->everyTwelveHours() |   every twelve hours       |
| ->everyMonth()    | every month          |
| ->everySixMonths()  |  every six months          |
| ->everyFifteenDays()    |  every fifteen days        |
| ->on('13:30 2016-03-01') | at a specific date and time |
| ->at('13:30') | at a specific time |


Under the hood, Scheduled is using the great 
[lavary/crunz](https://github.com/lavary/crunz#frequency-of-execution) library.
It has a large number of options for us to configure the frequency of the execution.
Check out its official documentation if you are looking for more available frequency.   

### Before A Job Runs
To do something before a job is executed, we can use the *before()* hook:

For example:

```php
use Scheduled\Scheduled\Scheduled;
$schedule = new \Scheduled\Scheduled\Scheduled();

$scheduled
    ->run('/usr/bin/php backup.php')
    ->before(function() { 
        // Do something before the job runs
     })
    ->daily()
    ->description('Test');

// IMPORTANT: You must return the scheduled object
return $scheduled;
```

### After A Job Is Finished
To do something after a job is executed, we can use the *after()* hook:

For example:

```php
use Scheduled\Scheduled\Scheduled;
$schedule = new \Scheduled\Scheduled\Scheduled();

$scheduled
    ->run('/usr/bin/php backup.php')
    ->after(function() { 
        // Do something after the job is finished
     })
    ->daily()
    ->description('Test');
	
// IMPORTANT: You must return the scheduled object
return $scheduled;
```
